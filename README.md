# YOLO-Segmentation-with-frontend
This project uses YOLOv8 for real-time instance segmentation on images and videos, allowing users to upload media for object detection with masks and bounding boxes. Built with Streamlit, it features adjustable confidence thresholds, toggles for masks/bounding boxes, and download options, making computer vision accessible and interactive.
